    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Greek pasta dish is bursting with flavor: Classic Greek Spaghetti with Meat Sauce is made with luscious ground beef and tomato sauce, along with cheese-coated spaghetti.</p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil +3 tbsp for the pasta</li>
      <li>1 small onion chopped</li>
      <li>2-3 cloves</li>
      <li>2-3 alllspice berries</li>
      <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to making</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the beef has some fat in it, if it is too lean it will not have the texture or flavor we are looking for here.</li>
        <li>DO use the spices. While they may seem like a small part of the recipe, they impart the characteristic flavor of the Greek Meat Pasta Sauce. Do not use ground cinnamon in the sauce, it will be too harsh, only use a cinnamon stick.</li>
        <li>The best cheese to use here is dry mizithra. It is an aged sheep’s milk cheese that is very flavorful. You can find in ethnic markets. If you cannot find it, the next best choice would be Pecorino cheese, which is a hard Italian cheese also made from sheep’s milk.</li>
        <li>The pasta here is prepared Greek style. It is cooked a bit more than the Italians (so not exactly al dente) and then it is prepared in a casserole dish. You can just boil and strain, but this particular preparation of layering it with cheese is what really makes it an amazing dish.</li>
